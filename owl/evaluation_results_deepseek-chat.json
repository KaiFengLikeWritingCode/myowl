    "ground_truth": "No",
    "llm_response": "### Final Answer:\nBased on the available information:\n\n1. **Timeline Clarification**:\n   - The National Banking Act was enacted in **1863**.\n   - The query mentions a bank founded **42 years before the Act was expanded to include Hawai'i**. However, the first bank in Hawai'i, **First Hawaiian Bank (originally Bishop & Co.)**, was founded in **1858** (only 5 years before 1863). This discrepancy suggests the query's timeline may be incorrect or misinterpreted.\n\n2. **Expansion to Hawai'i**:\n   - The National Banking Act was expanded to include Hawai'i after it became a U.S. Territory in **1898** (following annexation). \n   - If we consider the bank founded in 1858, it would be **40 years before the Act's expansion to Hawai'i** (1898 - 1858 = 40), not 42.\n\n3. **Founder's Lifespan**:\n   - **Charles Reed Bishop** (founder of First Hawaiian Bank) lived from **1822 to 1915**.\n   - If the acquisition of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank occurred between **1898 (Act's expansion to Hawai'i) and 1915 (Bishop's death)**, he would have been alive. However, no reliable source confirms the acquisition date or the existence of Pioneer Federal Savings Bank in this context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe query contains a timeline inconsistency (42 years vs. actual 40 years). Assuming the intended bank is **First Hawaiian Bank (founded 1858)** and the Act's expansion to Hawai'i in **1898**, **yes**, its founder Charles Reed Bishop was still alive (until 1915) during the period when the acquisition could have occurred. However, the lack of information about Pioneer Federal Savings Bank's acquisition makes this answer speculative. \n\nIf you have additional details about the acquisition, I can refine the response further.",

His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.",

Hobby Airport (IATA: HOU)**, but its runways are longer than 7,000 ft.\n   - Recheck: The correct airport is **Sugar Land Regional (IATA: SGR)** with a 7,000 ft runway.\n\n3. **Rearrange SGR**:\n   - Original: **SGR** → Rearranged options ending with \"J\":\n     - **SRJ** (invalid)\n     - **RSJ** (invalid)\n     - **GSR** (invalid)\n     - **GRS** (invalid)\n     - **JSR** (invalid)\n   - No valid permutations ending with \"J\".
